# Plant Disease Detection
# Description
* A three step detection model for plant diseases was constructed using healthy and disease leaf images.
* Five different pre-trained models such as ResNet50, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG19, and EfficientNet were tested for each crop to develop the model.
* Step 1, the crop classification model was constructed model training and validation, of the five different pre-trained CNN models, the model showing the highest accuracy using the separated test set was selected as the final model.
* After accurate crop recognition, detection models were used to determine disease occurrence for individual crops by detecting the presence or absence of disease symptoms or patterns of symptoms.
* If a disease was detected in step 2, it was necessary to determine the type of disease in Step 3.
* Highest accuracy was shown by EfficientNet.
